# NASA APOD Project

This project is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) exercise that fetches [NASA's APOD](https://api.nasa.gov/) API to display on my own page.
It was created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## What I learned

- Basic React state management, hooks and props
- API calls using [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- How to cache data in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- React good practices [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- CSS animations
